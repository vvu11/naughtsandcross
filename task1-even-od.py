#write a program that outputs 'even' if number is even and 'odd' if number is odd - and if neither

number = int(input("Enter your value without decimal: "))

if (number % 2) == 0:
    print(f"{number} is even")
else:
    print(f"{number} is odd")
#still figuring out what to do if there is dec and how to impliment code if neither od or even
