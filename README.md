Naughts and Crosses 

This is a two player game where each player takes a turn to place a counter. Either naughts (o) or crosses(x)
The first player to match three: diagonally, horizontal or vertical wins
In my programme, there are two players, and two different colours/ and counters
each player takes a turn to input their coordinates. These are instructions stated on how to play:
  You will be asked for a coordinate. These range from a, b, c and 0, 1, 2 
  The letters correspond with the x-axis, and the numbers correspond with the y
  Simply enter the letter and the number you wish to place your piece with no spaces or commas inbetween (e.g a1) 
The players will decide who wins in this programme
